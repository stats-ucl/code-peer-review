# Student Guide: Code Peer Review with GitHub

## What is Code Peer Review? Why on Github?

Code peer review is when you look at another student's code and give them helpful feedback, just like when you review each other's essays. At the same time, other students will review your code and give you feedback. This helps everyone learn from each other and improve their coding skills. Learning to review code and use GitHub will help you in your career because:

- Most tech companies use GitHub or similar tools
- Code review is a standard practice in professional programming
- It teaches you to read and understand other people's code
- It helps you write clearer, better code
- It's a valuable skill to mention in job applications

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website that programmers use to share and work on code together. Think of it like Google Docs, but specifically designed for computer code. Don't worry if you've never used it before - this guide will walk you through everything step by step!



## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your GitHub Account

If you already have one under some other email account and want to use it for the code review, then please go to the next section. Otherwise:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" 
3. Choose a username (tip: use something professional as you might use this for job applications later!)
4. Use your UCL email address
5. Create a strong password
6. Verify your email when GitHub sends you a message

### Step 2: Upload Your Assignment to Moodle
- Submit your code assignment to Moodle as you normally would
- **Also include your GitHub username** in your submission or as requested by your teacher



## How the Peer Review Process Works

### What Happens Behind the Scenes
1. Your teacher will create a private space (called a "repository" or "repo") for your code on GitHub
2. Your code will be automatically moved from Moodle to this private space
3. Two other students will be randomly chosen to review your code
4. You will also be chosen to review two other students' code
5. Everything is kept private - only you, your reviewers, and your teacher can see your code

### Your Role as a Reviewer

When you're reviewing someone else's code, you'll do two things:

#### Part 1: Fill Out a Review Form (Required)
You'll answer some questions about the code you're reviewing, such as:
- Is the code easy to read and understand?
- Does the code seem to work correctly?
- What did you like about this approach?
- Do you have any suggestions for improvement?
- Did you learn anything new from this code?

**How to do this:**
1. Click the link your teacher sends you to access the code
2. Look for a button or link that says "Issues" 
3. Click "New Issue"
4. You'll see a template with questions - just fill in your answers
5. Click "Submit new issue" when you're done

#### Part 2: Suggest Code Changes (Optional)
If you spot a bug or have an idea for improvement, you can suggest specific changes to the code.

**How to do this:**
1. Find the code file you want to change
2. Click the pencil icon (edit button) 
3. Make your suggested changes
4. At the bottom, write a message explaining what you changed and why
5. Click "Propose changes"
6. Click "Create pull request"
7. Add a description of your suggestion and click "Create pull request"



## After the Review: Receiving Feedback on Your Code

### Where to Find Your Reviews
1. Go to your private repository (your teacher will send you the link)
2. Click on "Issues" to see the review forms your peers filled out
3. Click on "Pull requests" to see any code changes they suggested

### How to Use the Feedback
- Read through all the feedback carefully
- Ask questions if something isn't clear (you can reply to issues and pull requests)
- Consider implementing suggested improvements
- Remember: feedback is meant to help you learn, not to criticize you personally



## Tips

### Common GitHub Terms Explained

- **Repository (Repo)**: Your private folder containing your code
- **Issue**: A place to discuss problems, ask questions, or give feedback
- **Pull Request**: A suggested change to the code
- **Branch**: Different versions of your code (don't worry about this too much for now)
- **Commit**: Saving changes to your code

### Writing Good Reviews
- **Be kind and constructive**: Instead of "This is wrong," try "Have you considered trying this approach?"
- **Be specific**: Point out exactly what you're referring to
- **Highlight good things too**: If someone did something clever, tell them!
- **Ask questions**: "Why did you choose this method?" can lead to good discussions

### When You're Stuck
- Don't panic! GitHub can seem overwhelming at first
- Ask your teacher or classmates for help
- Most buttons are safe to click - you won't break anything
- Remember that everyone is learning

### Making the Most of Feedback
- Don't take criticism personally - it's about the code, not you
- Try to understand why reviewers made their suggestions
- Feel free to ask follow-up questions
- Use the feedback to improve your next assignment



## Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. Ask a classmate
2. Ask your teacher during lab sessions or through the Moodle forum
3. Check the GitHub help documentation
4. Remember: everyone finds GitHub confusing at first!

Remember: The goal isn't to become a GitHub expert overnight, but to learn from each other and improve your coding skills together!
